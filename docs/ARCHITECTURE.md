## Architecture Overview

### 1. **Frontend Architecture**

The frontend follows a **Progressive Enhancement** pattern with modular JavaScript:

**Module System:**
- **15 Specialized Modules** handling specific concerns (cart, search, forms, etc.)
- **Event-driven communication** between modules
- **Lazy loading** for performance optimization
- **Error boundaries** with automatic recovery

**Key Modules:**
- `cart.js` - Complete e-commerce cart with localStorage persistence
- `search.js` - Real-time search with debouncing and history
- `lightbox.js` - Advanced image viewer with touch support
- `error-handler.js` - Comprehensive error management
- `logger.js` - Structured frontend logging

**Build Process:**
- Webpack 5 with multiple entry points
- Code splitting for optimal loading
- Terser for minification
- CSS extraction and optimization

### 2. **Backend Architecture**

Express.js server with layered middleware architecture:

**Request Flow:**
1. **Security Layer:** Helmet, rate limiting, CSRF protection
2. **Session Management:** File-based or MongoDB sessions
3. **Authentication:** Session-based admin auth with bcrypt
4. **API Routes:** RESTful endpoints for data operations
5. **Static Serving:** Optimized asset delivery with caching

**Security Features:**
- Rate limiting (100 requests/15min general, 10/15min for login)
- CSRF tokens for form submissions
- Secure session configuration
- Input validation and sanitization
- Comprehensive error handling

### 3. **Data Architecture**

**Current State:**
- Artwork data stored in JSON file (`artwork-data.json`)
- 40+ artwork entries with metadata
- Categories: Floral, Towns, Birds
- Session data in file system or MongoDB

**Data Structure:**
```json
{
  "id": "unique-identifier",
  "title": "Artwork Title",
  "category": "birds|floral|towns",
  "dimensions": "20cm X 20cm",
  "medium": "Acrylic on Canvas",
  "price": 500,
  "image": "path/to/webp/image",
  "featured": false
}
```
