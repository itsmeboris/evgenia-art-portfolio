## üü° **MEDIUM PRIORITY**

### ‚ö° Implement Cache Invalidation for Admin Saves

**Priority:** MEDIUM | **Effort:** 1 day | **Impact:** 8/10
**Status:** Not Started

- [ ] Add cache-busting headers when admin operations occur
- [ ] Create cache management API endpoints for manual invalidation
- [ ] Implement intelligent cache warming after admin updates
- [ ] Add cache status indicators in admin panel

**Context:** Current API has 5-minute cache (`max-age=300`) which prevents real-time updates after admin saves. During migration testing, cache was temporarily disabled to verify workflow - now needs production-ready cache invalidation.

**Expected Impact:** Real-time admin changes reflected immediately in frontend gallery without manual cache clearing.

**Added:** January 14, 2025 - Post migration production optimization

**Context:** **CRITICAL GAP DISCOVERED** - Database API migration is complete, but JSON files become stale after database changes. This breaks the fallback strategy and creates data inconsistency.

**Technical Requirements:**
- Database changes must trigger JSON file updates
- Fallback JSON files must stay synchronized with database
- Manual refresh capability for immediate sync needs

**Expected Impact:** Maintains data consistency across all layers, ensures reliable fallback functionality, prevents stale data issues.

**Added:** January 14, 2025 - Critical gap identified during API migration research

**Current Gap:** Users can upload images but must manually create artwork records separately.

**Expected Impact:** Streamlined content management, reduced manual work, improved admin user experience.

**Added:** January 14, 2025 - Workflow gap identified during upload process analysis
