## üü† **HIGH PRIORITY**

### üîÑ Migrate Frontend from JSON to Database API

**Priority:** HIGH | **Effort:** 4-6 days | **Impact:** 9/10
**Status:** Not Started

The backend database migration is complete with 40 artworks migrated and API v1 endpoints fully functional. However, the frontend still loads data from `/public/data/artwork-data.json` instead of using the database API.

**Frontend Components Requiring Migration:**
- [ ] Update artwork-loader.js to use `/api/v1/artworks` instead of JSON file
- [ ] Modify all frontend components to handle API response format
- [ ] Replace admin panel JSON download/upload workflow with real-time database API
- [ ] Implement proper error handling and loading states for API failures
- [ ] Add retry logic and offline handling for network failures
- [ ] Update image handling for database-stored metadata
- [ ] Test all artwork display, filtering, and search functionality
- [ ] Verify meta tags and sitemap generation work with API data

**Technical Details:**
- Backend API verified working: 40 artworks, pagination, CRUD operations
- Frontend expects specific JSON structure that may need API format alignment
- Admin panel requires complete architectural overhaul from file-based to API-based workflow

**Completion Criteria:**
- All frontend components load data from database API, not JSON files
- Admin panel performs real-time database operations
- No references to `/public/data/artwork-data.json` in active code
- All functionality maintains current UX quality with proper loading states

**Verification (July 28, 2025):** ‚ùå Confirmed - frontend still uses JSON file, no API integration found.

### üîß Address PM2 Security Vulnerability

**Priority:** HIGH | **Effort:** 0.5 days | **Impact:** 6/10
**Status:** Not Started

- [ ] Review PM2 Regular Expression Denial of Service vulnerability (GHSA-x5gf-qvw8-r2rm)
- [ ] Monitor for PM2 security updates
- [ ] Consider alternative process managers if fix unavailable
- [ ] Implement additional security measures around PM2 usage

**Notes:** Current PM2 version has a known RegEx DoS vulnerability with no fix available. Need to evaluate risk and potential alternatives.

**Issue Details:** https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-x5gf-qvw8-r2rm
