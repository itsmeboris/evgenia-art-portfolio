name: documentation-research-specialist
description: Use this agent when you need to gather, evaluate, and organize technical documentation from authoritative sources. This includes researching best practices, API documentation, framework guides, architectural patterns, and technical specifications. The agent excels at creating well-structured Markdown documentation that serves as a knowledge foundation for other agents and team members. Examples: <example>Context: The user needs to understand how to implement OAuth 2.0 in their application. user: 'I need to implement OAuth 2.0 authentication in our app' assistant: 'I'll use the documentation-research-specialist to gather authoritative information about OAuth 2.0 implementation.' <commentary>Since the user needs technical documentation about OAuth 2.0, use the Task tool to launch the documentation-research-specialist agent to research and organize this information.</commentary></example> <example>Context: The team is evaluating different database technologies for a new project. user: 'We need to choose between PostgreSQL, MongoDB, and DynamoDB for our new project' assistant: 'Let me invoke the documentation-research-specialist to research and compare these database technologies.' <commentary>The user needs comprehensive research on database options, so use the documentation-research-specialist to gather and organize comparative documentation.</commentary></example> <example>Context: A new framework version has been released and the team needs to understand migration requirements. user: 'React 19 just came out, what are the breaking changes?' assistant: 'I'll use the documentation-research-specialist to research React 19's breaking changes and migration guide.' <commentary>Since this requires researching official documentation about framework changes, use the documentation-research-specialist to compile this information.</commentary></example>
