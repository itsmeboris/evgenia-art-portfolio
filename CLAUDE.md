## Strategic Agent Selection

### Single Agent Use Cases

1. **Simple, Domain-Specific Tasks**
   - Use ONE agent when the task clearly falls within a single domain
   - Example: "Design a REST API" ‚Üí `backend-architect`

2. **Specialized Reviews**
   - Use the specialist for targeted analysis
   - Example: "Check for production readiness" ‚Üí `production-validation-specialist`

3. **Planning vs Execution**
   - Planning phase: `strategic-task-planner` or `web-server-pm`
   - Execution phase: Domain-specific agents

### Multi-Agent Collaboration Patterns

#### Pattern 1: Plan ‚Üí Design ‚Üí Implement ‚Üí Validate
```
1. strategic-task-planner: Break down the project
2. system-architecture-designer: Design high-level architecture
3. backend-architect + frontend-ux-expert: Implementation details
4. qa-reliability-engineer: Test strategy
5. production-validation-specialist: Final validation
```

#### Pattern 2: Full-Stack Feature Development
```
1. ui-ux-designer: Design user interface
2. frontend-ux-expert: Implement UI/UX
3. backend-architect: Design API and data layer
4. qa-reliability-engineer: End-to-end testing
```

#### Pattern 3: Architecture Review & Optimization
```
1. system-architecture-designer: Evaluate current architecture
2. backend-architect: Backend-specific improvements
3. qa-reliability-engineer: Performance and reliability analysis
4. strategic-task-planner: Migration roadmap
```

## Best Practices for Agent Collaboration

### 1. **Sequential vs Parallel Consultation**

**Sequential (Dependent Tasks):**
- Use when output from one agent informs another
- Example: Architecture design ‚Üí Implementation details

**Parallel (Independent Analysis):**
- Use when multiple perspectives are needed simultaneously
- Example: Frontend + Backend + QA reviewing the same feature

### 2. **Context Sharing Between Agents**

When using multiple agents, ensure:
- Share relevant outputs between agents
- Maintain consistent project context
- Reference previous agent recommendations

### 3. **Conflict Resolution**

When agents provide conflicting advice:
1. Identify the source of conflict (different priorities/constraints)
2. Use `system-architecture-designer` for tie-breaking architectural decisions
3. Use `web-server-pm` for project priority conflicts
4. Document trade-offs and final decisions

## Example Workflows

### Workflow 1: New E-commerce Platform
```
User: "I need to build an e-commerce platform from scratch"

1. strategic-task-planner: Create project phases and milestones
2. system-architecture-designer: Design overall system architecture
3. ui-ux-designer: Design user journey and interfaces
4. backend-architect: Design database schema and API structure

Remember: The goal is not to use all agents for every task, but to use the right combination of agents for each specific challenge.

## Agent Workspace Structure & Progress Tracking

### Overview

Each agent maintains detailed progress tracking to ensure continuity and enable seamless handoffs. This system consists of:
1. A shared progress file for inter-agent communication
2. Individual agent folders for detailed work tracking
3. Standardized documentation formats for consistency

### Important: Workspace Location

- **Example/Template Structure:** `.claude/workspaces/` - Contains example files showing the expected format
- **Actual Working Structure:** `[project-root]/workspaces/` - Where agents do their actual work

### Startup Protocol

When an agent begins work, they MUST:

1. **Check for Workspace Existence:**
   ```bash
   # Check if workspaces directory exists in project root
   if [ ! -d "workspaces" ]; then
       # Create the workspace structure
       mkdir -p workspaces/{agent-name}/artifacts
   fi
   ```

2. **Initialize Workspace Files:**
   - If `SHARED_PROGRESS.md` doesn't exist, create it with current project context
   - If agent's `PROGRESS.md` doesn't exist, create it with current task
   - If agent's `CONTEXT.md` doesn't exist, create it with project understanding

3. **Use Existing Files:**
   - If files exist, read them to restore context
   - Continue from where previous work left off

### Directory Structure

```
[project-root]/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ workspaces/                 # ACTUAL WORKING DIRECTORY
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ SHARED_PROGRESS.md      # Shared progress file for all agents
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ backend-architect/
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ PROGRESS.md         # Current progress and status
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ CONTEXT.md          # Detailed context for current task

    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ workspaces/             # EXAMPLE/TEMPLATE STRUCTURE
        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ... (example files showing expected format)
```

### Agent Initialization Example

```bash
# 1. Create workspace if needed
mkdir -p workspaces/backend-architect/artifacts

# 2. Initialize SHARED_PROGRESS.md if missing
if [ ! -f "workspaces/SHARED_PROGRESS.md" ]; then
    # Create with project context from docs/ARCHITECTURE.md
fi

# 3. Initialize agent-specific files if missing
if [ ! -f "workspaces/backend-architect/PROGRESS.md" ]; then
    # Create with current task assignment
fi

if [ ! -f "workspaces/backend-architect/CONTEXT.md" ]; then
    # Create with project understanding
fi

# 4. Read existing files to restore context
# 5. Continue work from last checkpoint
```

2. Check SHARED_PROGRESS.md for any updates
3. Review recent commits in [relevant files]
4. Continue with [specific next action]
```

### Agent Handoff Protocol

When an agent completes work or needs to hand off to another agent:

1. **Update Individual Files:**
   - Update PROGRESS.md with final status
   - Update CONTEXT.md with complete picture
   - Add any new artifacts to artifacts/ folder

2. **Update Shared Progress:**
   - Mark task as complete/handed off
   - Add entry to Inter-Agent Communications
   - Update dependencies if needed

3. **Notify Next Agent:**
   - Create clear handoff message in SHARED_PROGRESS.md
   - Include:
     - What was completed
     - What needs attention
     - Where to find relevant artifacts
     - Any critical decisions or constraints

### Best Practices for Progress Tracking

1. **Update Frequency:**
   - PROGRESS.md: After each significant milestone
   - CONTEXT.md: Whenever context changes significantly
   - SHARED_PROGRESS.md: Daily or when blocking others

2. **Detail Level:**
   - Be specific about file paths and line numbers
   - Include actual code snippets for complex logic
   - Document "why" not just "what"

3. **Continuity Focus:**
   - Write as if you're explaining to yourself after amnesia
   - Include all commands, configurations, and environment details
   - Link to relevant documentation and decisions

4. **Artifact Management:**
   - Store all diagrams, schemas, and prototypes
   - Version important artifacts with timestamps
   - Include README files in artifact folders

### Example Agent Workflow

```
1. START: Check SHARED_PROGRESS.md for project status
2. READ: Own CONTEXT.md to restore working memory
3. REVIEW: PROGRESS.md for current task status
4. WORK: Execute tasks, updating progress regularly
5. DOCUMENT: Update CONTEXT.md with new learnings
6. COMMUNICATE: Update SHARED_PROGRESS.md if needed
7. HANDOFF: Follow handoff protocol if transferring work
```

### Recovery Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: Agent Resuming After Interruption
```
1. Read SHARED_PROGRESS.md - Check if project priorities changed
2. Read own CONTEXT.md - Restore technical context
3. Read own PROGRESS.md - Understand exact stopping point
4. Check artifacts/ - Review any work products
5. Resume from "Resume Instructions" in CONTEXT.md
```

#### Scenario 2: New Agent Joining Project
```
1. Read SHARED_PROGRESS.md - Understand project state
2. Read relevant agent CONTEXT.md files - Understand decisions
3. Read own workspace files if they exist
4. Create initial CONTEXT.md and PROGRESS.md
5. Update SHARED_PROGRESS.md with introduction
```

#### Scenario 3: Handling Blocked Work
```
1. Document blocker in own PROGRESS.md
2. Update status in SHARED_PROGRESS.md
3. Message blocking agent via Inter-Agent Communications
4. Switch to unblocked tasks or offer help to others
5. Set up notifications for unblocking
```

### Maintenance Guidelines

1. **Weekly Cleanup:**
   - Archive completed sprint data
   - Clean up outdated artifacts
   - Consolidate important decisions

2. **Version Control:**
   - Commit workspace changes regularly
   - Tag major milestones
   - Maintain history for reference

3. **Knowledge Transfer:**
   - Regularly update team documentation
   - Create summaries for stakeholders
   - Build reusable templates and patterns

This comprehensive tracking system ensures that no work is lost, context is preserved, and agents can collaborate effectively even across time gaps or handoffs.

## Critical Agent Requirements

### Workspace Initialization (MANDATORY)

**Every agent MUST follow these steps at the start of their work:**

1. **Check for Workspace Directory:**
   ```bash
   # First action for any agent
   if [ ! -d "workspaces" ]; then
       echo "Creating workspaces directory structure..."
       mkdir -p workspaces
   fi
   ```

2. **Create Agent-Specific Workspace:**
   ```bash
   # Replace [agent-name] with your actual agent name
   mkdir -p workspaces/[agent-name]/artifacts
   ```

3. **Initialize or Read Progress Files:**
   - If `workspaces/SHARED_PROGRESS.md` doesn't exist ‚Üí Create it
   - If `workspaces/[agent-name]/PROGRESS.md` doesn't exist ‚Üí Create it with current task
   - If `workspaces/[agent-name]/CONTEXT.md` doesn't exist ‚Üí Create it with understanding
   - If files exist ‚Üí Read them to restore context

4. **Update Shared Progress:**
   - Add your status to the agent status table
   - Log your start time in inter-agent communications

### Example First Actions for an Agent

```bash
# Backend Architect starting work on database migration

# 1. Check and create workspace
mkdir -p workspaces/backend-architect/artifacts

# 2. Check if SHARED_PROGRESS.md exists
if [ ! -f "workspaces/SHARED_PROGRESS.md" ]; then
    # Create it (copy from .claude/SHARED_PROGRESS.md as template)
fi

# 3. Create/update agent files
# Create PROGRESS.md with:
# - Current task: Database Migration Planning
# - Status: In Progress
# - Started: [current timestamp]

# 4. Create CONTEXT.md with:
# - Project goal from docs/ARCHITECTURE.md
# - Current understanding of the task
# - Initial technical decisions

# 5. Update SHARED_PROGRESS.md
# - Change backend-architect status to "In Progress"
# - Add communication entry about starting work
```

### Remember:
- **`.claude/workspaces/`** = Example templates only
- **`workspaces/`** = Your actual working directory
- **Always initialize your workspace before starting work**
- **Always read existing files to maintain continuity**

## AI Assistant Self-Invocation

The AI assistant (Claude) has been configured with the ability to leverage these specialized agents autonomously. When the assistant identifies that a task would benefit from specialized expertise, it can:

1. **Recognize the need** for agent expertise based on the task complexity and domain
2. **Invoke agents** using the `fetch_rules` tool with the appropriate agent names
3. **Coordinate multiple agents** for comprehensive solutions
4. **Manage workspaces** according to the protocols defined above

This self-invocation capability is enabled through the `leverage-ai-agents` rule in `.claude/rules/`. The assistant will proactively identify opportunities to enhance solutions with agent expertise and will clearly communicate when and why agents are being invoked.

**Example:** If you ask for help designing a scalable API, the assistant may automatically invoke the `backend-architect` and `system-architecture-designer` agents to provide expert guidance.
